## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design



### What I learned

What I Learned:
Setting image widths to 100% inside containers ensures they scale with the layout.

Why It Matters:
Prevents layout breaking on smaller screens.

```html
<div class="card">
  <img src="assets/images/illustration-article.svg" alt="card">
</div>
```
```css
.card img{
    width: 100%;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```


### Continued development

- Media Queries Best Practices
- Touch-Friendly UI Elements
- Simplified Navigation
- Responsive Typography
