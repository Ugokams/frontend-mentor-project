# Frontend Mentor Projects

This repository serves as the main folder for all my **Frontend Mentor** projects and challenges.

## üìÅ Structure

Each project or task from Frontend Mentor is placed in its own subfolder within this repository. This setup allows for organized tracking of progress and easy navigation across multiple projects ‚Äî all in one place.

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (for interactive challenges)

## Notes

- All designs are responsive (working towards mobile-first).
- Each subfolder contains its own `README.md` file (where applicable) explaining the project scope and implementation.

## Why This Setup?

Keeping all projects in a single repository:
- Makes version control cleaner
- Avoids cluttering GitHub with multiple repos
- Helps show growth and learning over time in one place
